# Heat Pump System Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis

This thesis evaluates the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of a heat pump system for space heating and domestic hot water in a residential building. It includes a theoretical section explaining heat pump principles and system specifics, and two analytical parts focusing on performance and financial analysis.

## Performance Analysis

The analysis identified key variables correlating with energy consumption and COP for heating and summer seasons. Further clustering revealed insights, with temperature impacting COP and compressor speed affecting energy consumption. Prediction models were built and evaluated using various metrics.

## Financial Analysis

Using metrics like ROI, payback period, NPV, and IRR, the thesis assessed the economic feasibility of the heat pump system, comparing it with investment opportunities in bonds and stocks. The system was found to be efficient, especially with grants, nearly equaling stock investments' profitability. A comparison with an electric boiler in the same building was also conducted.

## Future Research

Future research can explore an in-depth evaluation of individual factors related to the heat pump system's efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Including additional variables in the analysis would offer a more comprehensive understanding. Improvements to prediction models, including the comparison of different machine learning algorithms, are worth exploring. Collecting more data, especially on solar efficiency, would provide valuable insights for future analyses.
